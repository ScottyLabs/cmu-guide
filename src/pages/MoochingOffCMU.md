## In Person Benefits

* **Pittsburgh Arts Pass** — https://www.cmu.edu/idplus/services/artspass.html 
This is a perk associated directly with your CMU ID; you can present it at the entrance to any of the following locations for free admittance:
  * Carnegie Museum of Art
  * Carnegie Museum of Natural History
  * Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens
  * Carnegie Science Center
  * Heinz History Center
  * Ft. Pitt Museum
  * Andy Warhol Museum
  * The Mattress Factory
  * The National Aviary
* **Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) Bus Pass**
With a CMU ID, you can use all of the PRT transportation options throughout the city for free, including the buses, light rail, and inclines!
* **CMU shuttle buses and escort services**
CMU shuttle buses generally go through residential areas that might be a longer walk from the nearest bus stop, and the escort service is an overnight pickup system. Neither of these are likely to really be helpful your first year, but they’re good to be aware of. The shuttle service stops at many nearby grocery stores which may be useful.
* **Pittsburgh Cultural Trust** — https://www.cmu.edu/staff-council/perks/index.html 
Ignore the fact that this is from the staff council. Groups of CMU students, staff, and/or faculty are all given special rates when purchasing tickets for various arts venues and performance groups belonging to the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust. These groups include:
  * Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
  * Pittsburgh Opera
  * Pittsburgh Ballet Theater
  * Pittsburgh CLO
  * Pittsburgh Public Theater
* **AT&T** — https://www.cmu.edu/hr/work-life/discounts/wireless.html 
AT&T offers a 10% off plan for students. Information about using this discount is available on the site linked and does not necessarily require switching plans; if you’re already using AT&T, you might be able to get 10% off of your current plan.
* **Printing Quota**
Ok this one is more of a shitpost but you have $40 of printing quota per semester, which is really 800 pages of black/white, ignoring the random discounts it gives sometimes. You can print whole books if you so choose.
* **AmTrak Student Discount** — https://www.amtrak.com/student-discounts 
AmTrak has a student discount of 15% (sometimes more) for travel planned in advance.
* **Car Insurance**
No, we’re not kidding. A lot of car insurance companies offer discounts for students maintaining some certain GPA, usually 3.0. This will vary depending on the insurance company, your driving history, etc., but it’s definitely something to ask about if you drive.
* **ZipCar** — https://www.cmu.edu/parking/about/zipcar.html 
This offer is particularly for students who will be on the Pittsburgh campus, but there are several ZipCars available in the East Campus Garage by Gesling Stadium for those with valid drivers licenses who sign up for accounts. This can be helpful if you need to get somewhere pretty fast.
* **CFA Performances**
All shows produced by the School of Drama are free for everyone with a CMU ID, and these have a reputation for being some of the highest quality university productions in the world. Similarly, performances by various elements of the School of Music are free to attend, some requiring ID and others being freely open to the public. 


## Digital Benefits

### Free Things
* **New York Times** — https://myaccount.nytimes.com/verification/edupass 
* **Wall Street Journal** — https://education.wsj.com/search-students/ 
* **Academic journals, databases, etc.** — https://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php 
* **GitHub Pro** — https://education.github.com/benefits 
* **Overleaf Premium** — https://www.overleaf.com/ 
You don’t actually need to sign up for anything yourself with this one since CMU handles it as an institutional discount. Just select the login with Google option in Overleaf, and then login with your Andrew ID as normal.
* **Microsoft** — https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools
If you actually have a use for Microsoft’s Azure suite (nerd) then go nuts!
### Discounts
* **Spotify Premium + Hulu + Showtime** — https://www.spotify.com/us/student/ 
Spotify Premium plus Hulu and SHOWTIME for only $5 a month is pretty wild.
* **Amazon Prime** — https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Student/
Amazon is might be an evil corporation, but six months of free Prime and then half-off forever is a pretty sweet deal
* **Apple Music** — Honestly not sure why you’d go for this over the Spotify bundle, but your money is your money. The only URLs to this deal are whole paragraphs long so just use Google like the grown up that you are now
* **Microsoft** — https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/store/b/education 
Free Office-365 Suite is kind of nice for when Google Docs, Slides, etc. just aren’t enough, but the real deal here is on hardware if you need a new laptop or tablet.
* **HP** — https://store.hp.com/us/en/cv/hp-education 
Similar to above, a wide array of discounts on hardware.
* **Apple** — https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store 
Apple is a lot more particular about their sales and they usually aren’t going to give you as large of a discount as the others but they will give you AirPods and other goodies when you buy more expensive items
### Miscellany
* **LibKey Nomad Chrome Extension** — Brings up a very non-invasive button to access articles directly through JSTOR or other academic and scholarly databases on a wide range of websites as long as CMU Libraries has access to the article.
